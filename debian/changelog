    New upstream releases of any tarballs still require mangling debian/rules,

    reality and what debian/rules had in it were responsible for odd failures
    in apache-modconf, which should now be fixed (closes: #291526)

    `Debian-GNU/Linux'.  Make Martin Michlmayr happy.

    check for logfiles outside /var/log/apache and echo a warning.

  * Uses better regular expression in init.d from Nicholas Lichtmaier.
  * It is now possible to backspace during the selection of Y or N
    within apacheconfig (#18310), which also fixes operation on sparc.
  * Configuration program no longer attempts to reconfigure a
    correctly-configured configuration during an upgrade (#17350, #18768,
    #18187).
  * Binds to port 80 even without an explicit Port directive (#18553).
  * The cron.daily script now correctly parses the obsolete and insecure
    Group number "#-1" in httpd.conf (#16146, #15693).
  * Fixed details of logfile locations in apache manpage (#20438).
  * The init.d script now uses the "graceful restart" reload method.
  * Closes #20569: log files listed multiple times are only aged once.
  * Updated initial site webpage.
  * Added yet more debhelperization, eliminating lintian errors.
  * Updated to Standards-Version 2.4.1.0.
  * Closes #18098 -- there is no demand for a 1.2.6 package, and only
    this 1.3.x has been tested in hamm).
  * Closes #18128 -- the postinst should not offer an inetd option, as the
    Apache Group has made it clear this "does not work propery -- avoid if
    at all possible.".
  * Demotes #20655 to severity fixed (apache no longer needs the non-free
    msql.h header to compile, mod_so replaces mod_dl, and dpkg-dev
    1.4.0.22 can extract the source package).
  * Released as -2 because a derivative of a -1 test release somehow found
    its way into Incoming.

    to non-debmake environments.
  * Corrected name of program in apache_monitor.8 manpage (Bug #7544).
  * Closed Bug #5601, since the need to use nph- filename to disable
    buffering of CGI program output is not a bug, but a feature.
  * Closed Bug #7132, which was fixed by the new apacheconfig in 1.1.3-3.
  * Closed Bug #7277, since undocumented.7.gz is now correct.
  * Closed Bug #7302, the mod_info bug incorrectly listed as 7017 below.
  * Closed Bug #7740 (posted against apache 3.0) (!), which was another
    manifestation of the bug located by Manoj Srivastava (Bug #6524)
    and fixed in 1.1.2-1.
  * Closed Bug #7744, since the apache 1.1.1-5 file permissions bug has
    long been fixed.
  * Package now includes file checksums (debmake 3.2.4).
  * Updated to Standards-Version 2.1.3.0.

apache (1.1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored -DSTATUS to Makefile.modules for mod_info (Bug #7017).
  * Fixed Bug #7297, where apacheconfig doesn't restart apache because the
    init.d script inadvertently kills itself.
  * Changed recommended DocumentRoot to /var/www (Bug #7318).
  * Removed empty /usr/doc/apache/modules directory.
  * Fixed some links from undocumented.7.gz to undocumented.7.
  * Config program now understands numerical IDs better, a deficiency
    pointed out by Dermot Bradley (bradley@mourne.gpl.net).  It isn't
    perfect, though, because chown doesn't understand, e.g., "-1".
  * Now validates installation scripts during package build using bash
    2.0.

 -- Johnie Ingram <johnie@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Feb 1997 13:25:30 -0500

apache (1.1.3-4) stable unstable; urgency=medium

  * Webstandard 3.0 savvy.
  * The /usr/lib/httpd directory is no more.
  * Moved icon directory to /usr/doc/apache/icons, cgi-bin directory to
    /usr/lib/cgi-bin, and created Alias /doc for /usr/doc, for compliance
    with Webstandard 3.0 at long last (Bug #6942); added checks and
    automagic config conversion code.
  * Closed bug #3470, since compliance with the webstandard means apache
    can coexist with the other web servers.
  * Added fallback to smail "mkaliases" command (Bug), and removed stop of
    apache before upgrade, by suggestion of Joey Hess (joey@kite.ml.org).
  * Added --force, --force-modules, --serveradmin, --serverroot,
    --servername, --port, and --update options (back) to apacheconfig.
  * Closed bug #4817, as CGI scripts are now required to be in /usr.
  * Source package can actually be unpacked with dpkg-source -x.
  * Updated default homepage, and fixed filename used for installation.
  * Minor tweaks to text formatting in apacheconfig and init.d scripts.
  * Removed apachemodname and install-apachemod programs, these having
    been superceded by new apacheconfig.
  * Closed Bug #7107, since the package now uses world-readable
    permissions on the icons (and does not use /usr/lib/httpd anyway).
  * Added dependency on perl.
  * Removed obsolete modules-descr and modules-doc targes from
    Makefile.modules.
  * Module mod_auth now loaded by default, because its necessity cannot
    always be determined from the standard ocnfig files.
  * Did I mention it was Webstandard 3.0 savvy?

apache (1.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Config program, rewritten in perl, now does an exhaustive check to
    decide which modules are needed, taking all provided mime types,
    handlers, and directives into account (Bug #4601).
  * Config program now supports both Apache 1.1 and 1.2, automatically
    detecting whether LoadModule or AddModule commands should be used.
  * Installation script no longer asks to make unnecessary changes (Bug
    #6945), and the configuration can be skipped if the files look good.
  * Default homepage is not installed if index.cgi already exists there
    (Bug #6973).
  * Config program now prefers the config_log_module over the
    common_log_module, knows the difference between the two (Bug #4683),
    and ignores commented-out directives (Bug #6780).
  * Corrected logfile pathname for the log modules from Apache to
    Debian default (Bug #6800).
  * First tentative step toward Webstandard 3.0: /usr/lib/cgi-bin
    included.
  * Diff no longer contains extraneous temporary directories (Bug #6803).
  * Source package updated to use debmake 3.0.11 flat directory structure.
  * Corrected spelling of "unprivileged" in configuration question.
  * Closed Bug #7031 (posted against 1.1.1-5), since the reference to
    /var/web/webspace has long been removed from the new-install homepage. 
  * Ran e2fsck -c on stupid /var partition, eliminating garbage from
    created diff files (Bug #6561).
  * Simplified /etc/init.d/apache script, and suppressed spurious error
    message from kill.
  * Config file backups are now rotated, so apacheconfig can be run
    multiple times without potential loss of data.
  * Closed Bug #7094 (posted against apache 3.1-8) (!), which was another
    manifestation of the bug located by Manoj Srivastava (#6524)
    and fixed in 1.1.2-1.
  * Closed Bug #7095, since the package can now repair broken 1.1.1-5
    permissions on the (obsolecent) /usr/lib/httpd directory.

apache (1.2b6-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Experimental release of Apache beta, sans autoconfig scripts.
    ("LoadModule" lines should be replaced with "ClearModuleList,
    AddModule...").

apache (1.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cron script now recognizes indented logfile directives (Bug #6784).
  * Fixed a problem with recognizing and correcting some PidFile
    directives which was reported by Jeff Noxon (jeff@planetfall.com).

apache (1.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version which fixes the new bugs introduced by
    security release 1.1.2 (sigh).
  * Added SuppressHTMLPreamble option to mod_dir IndexOptions with
    patch by Roy T. Fielding.
  * Hacked mod_info so it correctly shows current configuration from
    config files with absolute pathnames.
  * Modified mod_dir to recognize PHP/FI and server-parsed documents as
    HTML code (so it can extract the title from these as a description),
    and to increase the maximum size of the generated description.
  * Added SuppressHTMLPreamble and ScanHTMLTitles to IndexOptions in
    example srm.conf.
  * Added module mod_rewrite.
  * Package now suggests installing the (new) apache-modules package.

 -- Johnie Ingram <johnie@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Jan 1997 22:00:22 -0500

apache (1.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version which fixes security holes in mod_cookies and
    mod_dir (APACHE_MOD.advisory.1.13.97, Bug #6576).
  * Post-installation script can now find and install the sample
    access.conf and srm.conf files (Bug #6522).
  * Corrected Document Root in example access.conf (Bug #6523), startup
    script, and initial homepage, which removes the last vestiges of the
    "silly," (Bug #2802), "abominable" (Bug #3470) /var/web directory.
  * Fixed a typo in apacheconfig located by Manoj Srivastava (Bug #6524),
    which also fixes detection of the existing webmaster alias (Bug #5693)
    and eliminates the need to type Control-D during install (Bug #4724).
  * Post-installation script now asks for a "publiziced" name instead of
    an alternate name (Bug #3470).
  * Webmaster address default is now guessed from /etc/mailname instead
    of the local hostname (Bug #3470).
  * File listing in apache.8 corrected to reflect current practice.
  * Debian/GNU product token added to SERVER_VERSION.
  * Bug #5062 closed, since any further stripping of the modules would
    make them unloadable by apache.

apache (1.1.1-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * New maintainer.
  * Updated to Standards-Version 2.1.2.2 with debmake 2.53.
  * Fixed bad permissions on apache files and directores under /usr/lib;
    everything now world-readable (Bug #5234).
  * Document root changed to /home/www-data/webspace in default srm.conf
    (Bug #4694)
  * Symbols stripped from /usr/sbin/unescape (Bug #5062).
  * Source code and Debian scripts changed to use /var/run/apache.pid
    throughout (Bug #5842, FSSTND 5.10).
  * Cron script changed to automatically determine which logs need
    to be rotated (Bug #5843), and can now handle virtual webserver
    logs.
  * Sequence code changed so Apache starts up after the automounter and
    any database daemons.
  * Compiled with -DSTATUS for more complete reports from from
    info_module.
  * Default savelog time extended to one month.
  * Startup script changed to comply with proposed Standard for Console
    Messages.
  * Moved from "net" to new section "web".
  * Source code changelog now included in documentation.
  * Headers, source code, and API documentation now in separate package.
  * Minor changes to text formatting in apacheconfig and post-install
    script.

 -- Johnie Ingram <johnie@debian.org>  Wed, 1 Jan 1997 09:07:08 -0500

apache (1.1.1-5) unstable; urgency=LOW

  * Changed Configure, mod_dl.c and mod_dld.c to arrange for storing the
    names of dynamically loaded modules. Then changed mod_info.c so that
    it uses the names correctly instead of making a SIGSEGV.
  * The default document root is really found by first looking for an
      existent www-data passwd entry (it will anyway default to
      /home/www-data/webspace, but previously only the server was looking
      for ~www-data).
  * Corrected typos in the default homepage, home.html, changed default
      locations to reflect changes made in 1.1.1-4, and added some
      documentation in this page.
  * Corrected typos in my manual pages.
  * Added the install-apachemod(8) script to let other packages install or
      remove dynamically loadable modules by just calling this script,
      without having to know how things are done.
  * New modules are added at the end of the LoadModule block rather than
      at the beginning, just after the magic.
  * The apacheconfig(8) script now looks in .htaccess files under the
      directories listed in access.srm to determine the authentication
      modules that are needed.
  * Corrected the compilation of the db and msql authentication modules so
      that the .so files include the necessary libraries dependencies.
  * Removed the gdbm1 dependency from Apache because the dependency is
      only useful when loading the dbm authentication module. Added
      Suggests: entry for all libraries that modules may need.

apache (1.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=LOW

  * Fixed the getting of some paths in the config files.
  * Changed permissions to use root.www-data.
  * Corrected bug in mod_mime.c that made Content-type and
      Content-encoding be the same. I hope I didn't introduce other
      bugs...
  * Put the package back in net.
  * Built-in document root is /home/www-data/webspace. This is ugly
      but consistent with the wu-ftpd package, and should be overriden
      by the installer anyway.
  * None of the /etc/apache/*.conf files are listed in conffiles as
      apacheconfig(8) or the postinst may edit them.
  * Added option --serverroot to apacheconfig(8) and commented out the
      default ServerRoot in httpd.conf-dist so that apacheconfig(8)
      will ask for the value to use.
  * No CGI scripts are found in this package.

apache (1.1.1-3) non-free; urgency=LOW

  * Fixed mod_info.c: SIGSEGV bug (reported by Joey Hess
      <joey@kite.preferred.com>) and bad construction of configuration
      files paths. Note that the SIGSEGV bug comes from the fact that
      dynamically loaded modules do not have a name registered in the
      modules_names table, which means the information page will list
      modules as dyn_module_1, dyn_module_2, etc. instead of giving their
      exact names. (The problem has been reported to the Apache group.)
  * Put conffiles back in the package (omitted accidentally when moving
      to the new package format).

apache (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=LOW

 * New release by Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@debian.org>.
 * Moved some stuff again: things that were named apache-httpd are just
     named apache.
 * Made /var/run/apache and put things there.
 * Created /var/spool/apache for proxy caching.
 * Wrote mod_dl.c and created /usr/lib/apache filled with modules.
 * Many many changes to the package configuration system, including
     an apcheconfig script that determines which modules to load at
     startup.
 * Fixed bugs reported against previous packages.
