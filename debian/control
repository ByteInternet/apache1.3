Description: versatile, high-performance HTTP server
 The most popular server in the world, Apache features a modular
 design and supports dynamic selection of extension modules at runtime.
 Some of its strong points are its range of possible customization,
 dynamic adjustment of the number of server processes, and a whole
 range of available modules including many authentication mechanisms,
 server-parsed HTML, server-side includes, access control, CERN httpd
 metafiles emulation, proxy caching, etc.  Apache also supports multiple
 virtual homing.

 Separate Debian packages are available for PHP, mod_perl, Java
 Servlet support, Apache-SSL, and other common extensions.  More

Description: integration of perl with the Apache web server
 mod_perl allows the use of Perl for just about anything
 Apache-related, including <Perl> sections in the config
 files and the famous Apache::Registry module for caching
 compiled scripts.
 .
 It can produce anywhere from a 400% to 2000% speed increase
 on sites using perl scripts, and is used on many large script-
 based web sites - for example, http://slashdot.org.
